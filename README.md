# Backup Automation Script
This script is used to backup files (recursivley) either to a harddrive or a NAS

# Dependencies
    - Python 3.X

# Usage
Currently, the only way of using the script is by executing the **main.py**
file in the **src** directory. This can be done in any commandline-interface
(Unix based systems and Windows systems). 
On start the possibilities available to the user are displayed in the terminal window. By entering one of those options, the corresponding procedure will be called and the user gets asked from which directory files should be copied and where to. In case the 'File-Type-Backup' procedure got called, a list of relevant filetypes is asked.
